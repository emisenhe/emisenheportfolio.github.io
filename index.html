            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering<br>
                Purdue University<br>
                Graduation: December 2023<br>
                Relevant Course Work: Software Engineering, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,
                Introduction to Computer Security, Introduction to Computer Communication Networks
            </p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer Programming in Python, C, JavaScript, and Kotlin</li>
                <li>Wiring, Soldering, and Working with Electrical Components</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Approaches</h3>
            <p>I try to use three main approaches to my coding mentality</p>
            <ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Problem-Solving Mindset: When faced with coding challenges, my first course of action is to break larger tasks into manageable ones. If I can lay out a gameplan with small tasks, the larger tasks seems easier to conquer.</li>
                    <li>Adaptability and Continuous Learning: With the dynamic landscape of technology, I embrace the concept continuous learning. I am excited to learn new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies, viewing each opportunity as a chance to expand my skill set.</li>
                    <li>Collaboration and Communication: Collaboration and effective communication lie at the heart of my coding approach. I actively engage in team discussions, valuing every voice and idea.</li>
                </ol>
                
            </ol>

            <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning about Software Engineering as a career path during Senior Year of High School when I took AP Computer Science. 
                The way I looked at problems and understood concepts fit perfectly into the class plan. I excelled during this class and went on to 
                win the AP Computer Science award at my school. I have also always had a passion for learning and previewing new technologies. From the 
                GameCube, to the DS, to the Oculus Quest, I love learning about and playing with new technologies. When I started applying for colleges
                I knew that I wanted to pursue coding and decided to go into Computer Engineering to fufill my love of coding and working with technology.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the future of technology, especially the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. My goal is to dive into the world of AI, learn the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, and explore their potential applications in various fields.
                I'm enthusiastic about contributing to the development of AI-driven solutions that address complex challenges and improve the way we interact with technology. Whether it's enhancing user experiences, optimizing processes, or making sense of vast data sets, I aim to be at the forefront of this transformative field.
                As I continue to expand my skill set in full-stack development, I'm committed to bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and impactful web applications. I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals and contribute to projects that leverage AI's potential to create meaningful and innovative solutions.
                Ultimately, my dream is to be part of a dynamic team that pioneers AI-driven advancements, contributing to the betterment of society and helping shape the future of technology.

                    During the Summer of 2022, I worked at Eaton's corporate office in Moon Twp, PA. 
                    I delved more into the software side of things and worked with the newly constructed
                    Distributed Energy Resource Management System Team to help code alignment between the 
                    various global teams. I learned about Python standards and how to use Python Code Linters
                    of Pylint and Flake8 to help faciliate a greater code quality. As a greater impact I worked on
                    streamlining the continous integration and deployment pipeline with these standards to ensure the 
                    quality of all code pushed to the repository.

                    I learned a lot of electrical concepts and had my first experience with PLC Ladder Logic. 
                    I worked on a interactive display that no hangs on the wall in the Experience Center detailing Eaton's
                    line of Power Xpert Meters, Gateways, and Dashboards. I was able to present my display to a group of IEE 
                    Engineers and various customers looking at this technology. Below is an image of my product. For my final 
                    presentation, I recorded a video detailing my project that you can find on YouTube at this link: https://youtu.be/9C1AHP9x0Ek.
