            <ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Problem-Solving Mindset: When faced with coding challenges, my first course of action is to break larger tasks into manageable ones. If I can lay out a gameplan with small tasks, the larger tasks seems easier to conquer.</li>
                    <li>Adaptability and Continuous Learning: With the dynamic landscape of technology, I embrace the concept continuous learning. I am excited to learn new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies, viewing each opportunity as a chance to expand my skill set.</li>

                </ol>
                
            </ol>

            <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning about Software Engineering as a career path during Senior Year of High School when I took AP Computer Science. 
                The way I looked at problems and understood concepts fit perfectly into the class plan. I excelled during this class and went on to 
                win the AP Computer Science award at my school. I have also always had a passion for learning and previewing new technologies. From the 
                GameCube, to the DS, to the Oculus Quest, I love learning about and playing with new technologies. When I started applying for colleges
                I knew that I wanted to pursue coding and decided to go into Computer Engineering to fufill my love of coding and working with technology.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the future of technology, especially the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. My goal is to dive into the world of AI, learn the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, and explore their potential applications in various fields.
                I'm enthusiastic about contributing to the development of AI-driven solutions that address complex challenges and improve the way we interact with technology. Whether it's enhancing user experiences, optimizing processes, or making sense of vast data sets, I aim to be at the forefront of this transformative field.
                As I continue to expand my skill set in full-stack development, I'm committed to bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and impactful web applications. I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals and contribute to projects that leverage AI's potential to create meaningful and innovative solutions.
                Ultimately, my dream is to be part of a dynamic team that pioneers AI-driven advancements, contributing to the betterment of society and helping shape the future of technology.

        <article class="experience-entry">
            <h3 class="experience-title">Dick's Sporting Goods - Software Engineer Intern</h3>
            <p class="experience-date">May 2023 - August 2023</p>

                <p>
                    As a Summer Software Engineering Intern, I had the opportunity to collaborate on a full-stack interactive portal, broadening my technical skills in both front-end and 
                    back-end development. Throughout my internship, I actively engaged with engineers, designers, and project managers, participating in daily stand-ups and sprint planning sessions. 
                    This exposure to agile methodologies gave me insight into the software development process and the significance of clear communication in achieving project milestones.
                    I worked with various programming languages and tools during my internship, gaining proficiency in JavaScript and Kotlin. I collaborated with another intern on an interactive portal
                    project, where we successfully addressed teammate concerns and improved project efficiency. Participating in daily stand-ups, design meetings, and engineering feedback
                    sessions provided me with valuable hands-on experience, expanding my technical expertise and honing my problem-solving skills.
                    My internship experience exposed me to the fast-paced and collaborative nature of software engineering, providing me with a deeper understanding of the skills and dedication required
                    to excel in the field. I am excited to leverage the skills and knowledge gained during my internship to further my career and contribute to other projects in the future.

                    Additionally during the internship, I participated in my first hackathon. I was on a team of six interns with one product manager, one product design, and 4 software engineers. Our team
                    created a chat box style front-end using Android development with React Native with a customizable generative AI backend using Chat GPT and OpenAI.

                    During the Summer of 2022, I worked at Eaton's corporate office in Moon Twp, PA. 
                    I delved more into the software side of things and worked with the newly constructed
                    Distributed Energy Resource Management System Team to help code alignment between the 
                    various global teams. I learned about Python standards and how to use Python Code Linters
                    of Pylint and Flake8 to help faciliate a greater code quality. As a greater impact I worked on
                    streamlining the continous integration and deployment pipeline with these standards to ensure the 
                    quality of all code pushed to the repository.
